<!--
    Understand:
        Rock Paper Scissors game:
            The user will input a choice and the computer will make a choice. The user's choice will
            be compared against the computer's and a winner will be decided. There will be 5 rounds.
            The scores will be recorded.
    Plan:
        Input: from User through console, case insensitive
        Computer Input: Randomly generated
        Output: The winner of each round, along with what choices were made will be presented.
        Algorithm:
            !   Use a game function to play the rounds of the game with a loop
            !   Declare variables for player score and computer score
            !   Prompt the user for their choice of rock, paper, or scissors
                !   If the user input is invalid, prompt again
            !   Parse the user input so that it is evaluated as case insensitive
            !   Save user input in a variable
            !   Get the computer's randomly generated choice through a function
            !   Save the computer's choice in a variable
            !   Pass the user's choice and the computer's choice to a function that will:
                !   Decide the winner
                !   Output the results
                !   Update the score
                !   Output the score
